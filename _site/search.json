Then the data frames were joined to analyze the change in sales of vehicles from 2003 to 2018. The average car price increased by almost 200% from 2003 to 2018 (due to inflation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of cars has increased over the years, as inflation increased drastically during the recession of 2009 and the recession due to the effects of COVID-19. This caused car prices to inflate as used cars became more expensive, even going as far as exceeding their sticker price."
